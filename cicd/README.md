This is my AWS CI/CD infrastructure module to deploy an application to ECS. The appplication sits behind a load balancer with security and roles in place. The pipeline is triggered from a push to repository.


-This is a frontend configuration only.
-Planning to add ECS autoscaling, and certificate configurations at some point
